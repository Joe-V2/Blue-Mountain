Watchface for the fitbit versa that does these things:

* Tracks the phase of the moon and displays it at night
* Calculates sunrise and sunset for the user, and displays the daylight and moonlight remaining as a rotation of the sun and moon 
* Changes the background and sprites to reflect the time of day

Known bugs:
* slight lag acquiring gps data for the first time

To install:
* grab the fitbit simulator, a versa or versa 2
* connect it to the developer bridge
* open a terminal in the root of this repo and type "npx fitbit bi"
